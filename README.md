# Automate the Amazon website using WebdriverIO

This repo is part of my [WebdriverIO Amazon Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DoQAGIBEUo&list=PL6AdzyjjD5HCF69b7Y_aOOlrJTM5kwvNO). In this series, we will automate the Amazon website and go over common interview questions that get asked in a technical coding interview.

We cover the following scenarios -  
- Project Setup
- Access the website and validate the URL and title 
- Search content and validate via text
- Auto suggestion handling from search 
- Check cart quantity as you add item
- Go to cart, change quantity, and verify the amount
